### Descrition 

This is one of the very first of five web programming projects needed to complete [freecodecamps](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - [responsive web design certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design).

I also tried following git flow by creating [issues](https://github.com/samirzjadhav/fcc-tribute-page/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for user stories and creating [pull requests](https://github.com/samirzjadhav/fcc-tribute-page/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) which implements those user stories.
